**Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF) Clustering**

📌 Course: Software Project - Tel Aviv University

🔍 Languages: Python, C

Project Overview:

This project implements Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF) for clustering, combining Python and C for efficiency. It compares SymNMF with K-Means clustering on different datasets.

Features & Functionality :

✅ Computes similarity, diagonal degree, and normalized similarity matrices

✅ Performs SymNMF clustering using matrix factorization

✅ Implements an efficient C extension for performance optimization

✅ Compares SymNMF with K-Means using silhouette scores
